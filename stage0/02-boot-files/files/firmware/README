An overview of the files on the /boot/firmware partition (the 1st partition
on the SD card) used by the Ubuntu boot process (roughly in order) is as
follows:

* bootcode.bin   - this is the second stage bootloader loaded by all pis with
                   the exception of the pi4 (where this is replaced by flash
                   memory)
* config.txt     - the configuration file read by the boot process
* start*.elf     - the third stage bootloader, which handles device-tree
                   modification and which loads...
* uboot*.bin     - various u-boot binaries for different pi platforms; these
                   are launched as the "kernel" by config.txt
* boot.scr       - the boot script executed by uboot*.bin which in turn
                   loads...
* vmlinuz        - the Linux kernel, executed by boot.scr
* initrd.img     - the initramfs, executed by boot.scr
